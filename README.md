# Retailer-KPI-s-in-Streamlit
As second term capstone project of my Master's Degree in Computer Science, several Key Performance Indicators from real H&M data had to be obtained and displayed in an online application, so let me introduce you to it!
## Description
My goal for this capstone project was to integrate all the Data Analytics, Javascript and Python knowledge gained so far, that's why I decided to take the capstone a little bit further and instead of creating just a streamlit application, I integrated the streamlit application into an E-Commerce web. That way I had included Python for the E-commerce web backend, the API and Streamlit; Javascript for the front end of the web page, and Data Analytics with pandas to obtain the KPI's.
